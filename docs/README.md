# Howdy Partner 

#### Welcome to the Backend Training Program of Technical Consultant Onboarding

This program is tailored with the basics of Odoo development to help partners achieve a deep understanding of the
framework as well as the best practices. By the end of the program, you will be equipped with knowledge to add custom features, or remove and modify
existing features as per clients' requirements.

Please note that the exercises available on this site assume that you have either completed or are currently undertaking the
backend training program with a technical consultant at Odoo Middle East.
